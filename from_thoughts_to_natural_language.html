    <h1 id="part-1-from-thoughts-to-natural-language">Part 1: From
    Thoughts to Natural Language</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning of the series <strong>From Natural Language
    to Logic Computation</strong>, where we explore different concepts
    and methods that allow us to extract the logical structure behind
    our words. Step-by-step we will build an <strong>engine</strong>
    using <code>Python</code>, <code>SQLite</code>, <code>spaCy</code>,
    and some <code>LLM</code> magic, to grow from <em>context</em>, to
    <em>axioms</em> and <em>propositions</em>, in order to prove those
    automatically. This will help to detect <em>contradictions</em>,
    <em>claims</em>, <em>facts</em>, and <em>undecidable statements</em>
    that pinpoint where more data is needed.</p>
    <h2 id="sentences">Sentences</h2>
    <p>As everything important in life, we begin with philosophical
    questioning: <strong>what is a sentence?</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>From a linguistics point of view, a sentence is a unit of
    language that expresses <strong>a complete thought</strong>, and
    typically consists of a <strong>subject</strong> (or implied
    subject) and a <strong>predicate</strong>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>One sentence, one thought! That’s it. Looks simple, but
    <strong>this is the most powerful tool of humanity before the
    written word</strong>. Any thought you can have can be expressed as
    a sentence, and we just take it for granted. But imagine one of our
    ancestors 20k years ago trying to explain the strategy tomorrow to
    hunt deer. Not many words, so many signs and gestures. Let’s
    continue with the definition of sentence.</p>

    </figure>
    <blockquote>
    <p>A sentence is syntactically independent and usually contains a
    <strong>finite verb</strong>, allowing it to stand alone as a
    <strong>coherent statement</strong>, <strong>question</strong>,
    <strong>command</strong>, or <strong>exclamation</strong>. They are
    governed by grammatical rules and can be analyzed in terms of
    structure (e.g., simple, compound, complex) as well as function
    (e.g., declarative, interrogative, imperative).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Ok, this is interesting for two reasons. Let’s see below.</p>
    <p><strong>1. There are different classes of sentences.</strong></p>
    <p>This makes sense because they are different types of thoughts.
    So, from a pragmatic point of view, sentences can be:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Interrogative:</strong> “What time is it?” / “Did you
    finish your homework?”</li>
    <li><strong>Imperative:</strong> “Close the door.” / “Pass the salt,
    please.”</li>
    <li><strong>Exclamatory:</strong> “What a beautiful day!” / “How
    amazing that was!” / “Dance!”</li>
    <li><strong>Performative:</strong> “I promise to be there.” / “I
    will sell that house tomorrow.”</li>
    <li><strong>Optative:</strong> “Long life and prosper.” / “If only I
    were rich!”</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Sensical or Meaningless:</strong> “The sky is
    horse.” / “I’m a lemon, because I’m - immortal.”</li>
    <li><strong>Social Formulas:</strong> “Hello friend!” / “Good
    luck!”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These distinctions matter because an engine will want to focus on
    propositions, claims, and statements (declarative sentences).</p>
    <p><strong>2. They have different grammatical
    structures.</strong></p>
    <p>Sentences have different structures (<em>syntactic
    arrangement</em>). The main structures are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Simple:</strong> Contains <strong>one independent
    clause</strong>: a subject + predicate, e.g. “She reads books.”</li>
    <li><strong>Compound:</strong> Combines <strong>two or more
    independent clauses</strong>, joined by coordinating conjunctions
    like <em>and, but, or</em>, e.g. “She reads books, and he writes
    stories.”</li>
    <li><strong>Complex:</strong> Contains <strong>one independent
    clause + at least one dependent clause</strong>, introduced by
    subordinating conjunctions like <em>because, although, when</em>,
    e.g. “She reads books because she loves learning.”</li>
    <li><strong>Compound-Complex:</strong> Combines <strong>multiple
    independent clauses + at least one dependent clause</strong>,
    e.g. “She reads books, and he writes stories because they love
    literature.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Complex sentences might require breaking down into smaller
    logical units to be handled. But structure alone isn’t enough.
    Context often decides what a sentence really means.</p>
    <h2 id="context-is-king-the-ambiguity-problem.">Context is King (the
    ambiguity problem).</h2>
    <p>A sentence that seems <strong>nonsensical</strong> in isolation
    might make perfect sense in a specific situation, like inside a
    poem, a joke, or a manual. Similarly, a simple statement like
    <em>“It’s cold.”</em> can function as an observation, a request (to
    close a window), or even a warning, depending on the context in
    which it’s spoken. This is also known as <strong>The ambiguity
    problem</strong>.</p>
    <h3 id="the-role-of-context-in-sentence-interpretation">The Role of
    Context in Sentence Interpretation</h3>

    centuries</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>There are different types of context. Let’s review some of
    them:</p>
    <p><strong>Linguistic Context</strong>: The surrounding words and
    sentences can clarify meaning. For example <em>“She saw the man with
    the telescope.”</em>. In this sentence, Is <em>“with the
    telescope”</em> describing the man or how she saw him? Only nearby
    sentences can help to resolve this ambiguity.</p>
    <p><strong>Situational Context</strong>: The physical setting,
    speaker, and listener influence interpretation. If someone shouts
    <em>“Fire!”</em> in a theater, it’s an alarm. The same word at a
    campsite might just be a request to light one.</p>
    <p><strong>Cultural Context</strong>: Shared knowledge shapes
    understanding. <em>“Break a leg!”</em> is encouragement in theater
    but literal elsewhere. Sarcasm (e.g., <em>“Great, another
    meeting…”</em>) relies on tone and cultural norms.</p>
    <p><strong>Cognitive Context</strong>: A listener’s background
    knowledge matters. <em>“The Eiffel Tower is in Paris.”</em> makes
    sense if you know what/where Paris is.</p>
    <h3 id="the-flexibility-of-sentences">The Flexibility of
    Sentences</h3>
    <p>Because of context, sentences are incredibly adaptable. A single
    structure can serve multiple purposes: - <em>“You’re leaving?”</em>
    (question) vs. <em>“You’re leaving?”</em> (statement or accusation).
    - <em>“Nice weather.”</em> could be genuine, sarcastic, or small
    talk.</p>
    <p>Even “incomplete” fragments (<em>“Coffee?”</em>, <em>“No
    way!”</em>) function as full sentences in conversation. <strong>This
    fluidity is why language is alive, it bends to fit human
    thoughts.</strong></p>
    <h2 id="next-time">Next time</h2>
    <p>Now that we’ve seen how sentences capture thoughts—and how
    context shapes them—the next step is turning these ideas into
    something a computer can work with, like <strong>First Order
    Logic</strong>, a system computers use to turn statements into
    precise, calculable forms.</p>
    <p><strong>Have you ever said a sentence that was misunderstood due
    to context?</strong> See you later…</p>
